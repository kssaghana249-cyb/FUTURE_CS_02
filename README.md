Intern Name: Saghana K S  
Track: Cybersecurity  
Task Code: FUTURE_CS_02  

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes phishing email samples to identify malicious indicators, classify risk levels, and provide prevention guidelines. The objective is to enhance cybersecurity awareness and help users recognize and prevent phishing attacks.

---

## Objectives

- Identify phishing indicators  
- Analyze email headers  
- Classify emails as Safe / Suspicious / Phishing  
- Provide cybersecurity awareness tips  

---

## Tools Used

- Google Admin Toolbox – Message Header Analyzer  
- Email header inspection  
- Manual phishing indicator analysis  
- MS Word / PDF documentation  

---

## Analysis Approach

1. Collected phishing email samples  
2. Checked sender domain mismatches  
3. Analyzed SPF, DKIM, DMARC authentication results  
4. Identified urgency tactics and social engineering indicators  
5. Classified risk level based on findings  
6. Provided prevention and awareness recommendations

## Risk Classification Criteria

| Risk Level | Description |
|------------|------------|
| Safe | Authenticated sender with no suspicious indicators |
| Suspicious | Minor inconsistencies or unclear authentication |
| Phishing | Domain mismatch, failed authentication, malicious intent |

---

## Key Findings

All analyzed email samples failed authentication checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) and showed domain mismatches, urgency-based language, and suspicious links. Therefore, all emails were classified as **Phishing**.
